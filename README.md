# County Ranker

This project aims to provide a tool for users to rank counties in the United States based on their demographic attributes. The tool allows users to input their desired demographic filters, and outputs a list of counties that match their criteria. The project uses a county demographics dataset obtained from the CORGIS project, containing demographic attributes such as age, education, ethnicity, housing, income, and population. 
The dataset can be found [here](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/python/county_demographics/).

## Problem Statement
Moving to a new county can be a daunting task, especially for individuals or families who have specific demographic needs or preferences. It can be challenging to find counties that match these criteria, and the process can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Our project seeks to simplify this process by providing a tool that allows users to filter and sort counties based on their demographic attributes, and quickly identify counties that meet their criteria.

## Technologies and Algorithms
Our project is implemented in C++, using CLion as the development environment. We use the STL library for data processing and analysis, and use various sorting algorithms such as shell sort, merge sort, and quick sort to compare their efficiency in sorting the dataset. We also use indexing techniques to optimize search operations and speed up data retrieval.

## Usage
To use the tool, users can download the project repository and run the C++ code in the CLion IDE. The code contains functions to load and preprocess the dataset, as well as functions to filter and sort the data based on user input. Users can adjust the filter criteria by modifying the input parameters in the code, and obtain the output list of counties that match their criteria.

We hope that our tool can provide a valuable resource for individuals and families looking to relocate, and simplify the process of finding counties that match their demographic needs and preferences.
